# Mastering Ruby with Ruby Koans

Ruby Koans is a set of problems meant to be solved using a test driven development (TDD) approach. It is an efficient way to develop less error prone code by ensuring that your code does what "it's supposed to do" by demonstrating a failed test based on a deviation from your codes expected behavior. The objective for each problem within the path is to evaluate the failed test and modify it for success, then refactor the code for beauty and efficiency.

The role of this repository is to personally document my progress toward better understanding the Ruby language via the Koans path.
